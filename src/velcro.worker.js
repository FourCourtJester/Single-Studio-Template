 * Nothing connects until somebody pastes a link, so this costs you nothing on a
 * one-machine show -- and it cannot be added later without a redeploy, because a
 * `connect` that is absent at build time is a collaboration button that does not
 * exist. Leaving it in means the day somebody says "can my producer drive the
 * lower third", the answer is a link rather than a release.
 *
 * The address is never baked in. A studio deploys as static files and holds no
 * keys, so the board reads where to go from its own URL -- which is what makes an
 * invite link the whole of an operator's setup. See useRelay.
